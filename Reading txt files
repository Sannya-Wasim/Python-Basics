#One way to read or write a file in Python is to use 
#the built-in open function. The open function provides a 
#File object that contains the methods and attributes you 
#need in order to read, save, and manipulate the file.

# we read the file using an example txt file
ex1="Example1"
file1=open(ex1,"r")

file1.name #print path name of file
file1.mode  #print the mode of file
# We can read the file and assign it to a variable
filecontent=file1.read()
print(filecontent)
# type of file content
type(file1)
#It is very important that the file is closed in the end. This frees up resources and ensures consistency across different python versions.
file1.close()
"""Using the with statement is better practice, it
automatically closes the file even if the code 
encounters an exception. The code will run everything
in the indent block then close the file object."""

with open(example1,"r") as file1
	file_conent=file1.read()
		print(file_content)# see the info in the file

# verify if file is closed
file1.closed()  # true

# if we want to read certain characters or lines we can pass a number to the read method
print(file1.read(4)) # this reads the first 4 characters inside the file
print(file1.read(5)) # this reads the next 5 characters since the read method is already called once

# we can also read one line at a time using readline method
print("first line : "+fle1.readline())
# unlike the read() method, readline() cannot read more than one line npo matter how many arguments are passed 

#we can use a loop to iterate through each line
i=0
for i in file1
	print(i)
	i=i+1

# We can use the method readlines() to save the text file to a list:
files_as_list=file1.readlines()
# each element of list corresponds to a line of the text
print(files_as_list[0])
#prints the second line
print(files_as_list[1])
